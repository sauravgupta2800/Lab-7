POKEMON_LYRICS = 'I wanna be the very best. Like no one ever was. To catch them is my real test. To train them is my cause. I will travel across the land. Searching far and wide. Each Pokemon to understand. The power that\'s inside. (Pokemon, gotta catch \'em all.) Its you and me. I know it\'s my destiny. (Pokemon.) Oh, you\'re my best friend. In a world we must defend. (Pokemon, gotta catch \'em all.) A heart so true. Our courage will pull us through. You teach me and I\'ll teach you. Pokemon. (gotta catch \'em all.) Gotta catch \'em all. Yeah. Every challenge along the way. With courage I will face. I will battle every day. To claim my rightful place. Come with me, the time is right. There\'s no better team. Arm in arm we\'ll win the fight. It\'s always been our dream. (Pokemon, gotta catch \'em all.) Its you and me. I know it\'s my destiny (Pokemon.) Oh, you\'re my best friend. In a world we must defend. (Pokemon, gotta catch \'em all.) A heart so true. Our courage will pull us through. You teach me and I\'ll teach you. Pokemon (gotta catch \'em all.) Gotta catch \'em all. Gotta catch \'em all. Gotta catch \'em all. Gotta catch \'em all. Yeah! (Pokemon, gotta catch \'em all). Its you and me. I know it\'s my destiny. (Pokemon) Oh, you\'re my best friend. In a world we must defend. (Pokemon, gotta catch \'em all.) A heart so true. Our courage will pull us through. You teach me and I\'ll teach you Pokemon. (gotta catch \'em all). Gotta catch \'em all.

JIGGLE_JIGGLE = 'You have to have something that sticks. You have to have something that\'s monumental. When you walk out on stage, that\'s been monumental. (Jiggle, jiggle) Can you remember any of the rap that you did? My money don\'t jiggle, jiggle, it folds. I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure. It makes me want to dribble, dribble, you know. Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it. Six feet two in a compact, no slack. But luckily the seats go back. I got a knack to relax in my mind. Sipping some red, red wine. I sip booze from chalices, holding my palaces. Crib is so crampy suckers suffer from paralysis. Rhymes, I write them in the castle. You try to diss me and pretty soon your ass. Will squat in a cell \'cause I can tell you it\'s illegal. Treason, that\'s the reason I\'m regal. You do the time for the crime of lèse-majesté. And **** the police \'cause they can\'t arrest me. (They can\'t arrest me, they can\'t arrest me). (I like to see you wiggle, it makes me dribble, fancy a fiddle?). My money don\'t jiggle, jiggle, it folds. I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure. It makes me want to dribble, dribble, you know. Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it. Six feet two in a compact, no slack. But luckily the seats go back. I got a knack to relax in my mind. Sipping some red, red wine. (I like to see you wiggle, it makes me dribble, fancy a fiddle?). (I like to see you wiggle, it makes me dribble, fancy a fiddle?). (I like to see you wiggle, it makes me dribble, fancy a fiddle?). (I like to see you wiggle, it makes me dribble, fancy a fiddle?)'
ALPHABET = 'Now it\'s time for our wrap up. Let\'s give it everything we\'ve got. Ready, begin. Artificial amateurs aren\'t at all amazing. Analytically, I assault, animate things. Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat. Buildings are broken, basically I\'m bombarding. Casually create catastrophes, casualties. Canceling cats got their canopies collapsing. Detonate a dime of dank daily doin\' dough. Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low. Eatin\' other editors with each and every energetic. Epileptic episode, elevated etiquette. Furious fat fabulous fantastic. Flurries of funk felt feeding the fanatics. Imitators idolize, I intimidate. In a instant, I\'ll rise in a irate state. Juiced on my jams like jheri curls, jockin\' joints. Justly, it\'s just me, writin\' my journals. Kindly I\'m kindling all kinds of ink on. Karate kick type Brits in my kingdom. Let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is. Learned lame louses just lose to my livery. My mind makes marvelous moves, masses. Marvel and move, many mock what I\'ve mastered.  Niggas nap knowin\' I\'m nice naturally. Knack, never lack, make noise nationally.  Operation, opposition, off, not optional. Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals. Perfected poem, powerful punchlines. Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime. Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it\'s Quannum Quarrelers ain\'t got a quarter of what we got, uh. Really raw raps, risin\' up rapidly. Riding the rushing radioactivity. Super scientifical sound search sought. Silencing super fire saps that are soft. Tales ten times talented, they\'re too tough. Take that, challengers, get a tune up. Universal, unique untouched. Unadulterated, the raw uncut. Verb vice Lord victorious valid. Violate vibes that are vain make \'em vanished. Why I\'m all well, would a wise wordsmith. Just weaving up words weeded up, on my work shift. Xerox, my X-ray-diation holes extra large. X-height letters and xylophone tones.'
